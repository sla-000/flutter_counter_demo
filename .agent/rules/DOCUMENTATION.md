## Documentation

### Documentation Philosophy
* **Self-Explanatory Code:** Class and method names should be self-explanatory.
* **No Default Documentation:** Do not add public API documentation by default.
* **Comment Wisely:** Add comments ONLY if they explain uncommon behavior or non-obvious logic. Obvious comments are not needed.

### Writing Style
* **Be brief:** Write concisely.
* **Avoid jargon:** Don't use abbreviations unless widely understood.
* **Format:** Use backticks for code references.

## Accessibility (A11Y)
Implement accessibility features to empower all users, assuming a wide variety
of users with different physical abilities, mental abilities, age groups,
education levels, and learning styles.

* **Color Contrast:** Ensure text has a contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1**
  against its background.
* **Dynamic Text Scaling:** Test your UI to ensure it remains usable when users
  increase the system font size.
* **Semantic Labels:** Use the `Semantics` widget to provide clear, descriptive
  labels for UI elements.
* **Screen Reader Testing:** Regularly test your app with TalkBack (Android) and
  VoiceOver (iOS).
