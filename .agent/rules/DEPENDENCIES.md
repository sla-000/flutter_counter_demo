## Package Management
* **Pub Tool:** To manage packages, use the `pub` tool, if available.
* **External Packages:** If a new feature requires an external package, use the
  `pub_dev_search` tool, if it is available. Otherwise, identify the most
  suitable and stable package from pub.dev.
* **Adding Dependencies:** To add a regular dependency, use the `pub` tool, if
  it is available. Otherwise, run `flutter pub add <package_name>`.
* **Adding Dev Dependencies:** To add a development dependency, use the `pub`
  tool, if it is available, with `dev:<package name>`. Otherwise, run `flutter
  pub add dev:<package_name>`.
* **Dependency Overrides:** To add a dependency override, use the `pub` tool, if
  it is available, with `override:<package name>:1.0.0`. Otherwise, run `flutter
  pub add override:<package_name>:1.0.0`.
* **Removing Dependencies:** To remove a dependency, use the `pub` tool, if it
  is available. Otherwise, run `dart pub remove <package_name>`.
